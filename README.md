This is the crypto information web app that I have made using Coin Geco API.
This is the first time that I have used an API and this was confusing at times but overall a pretty smooth learning experience.
Technologies used:
1. HTML (JSX)
2. CSS
3. TAILWINDCSS
4. REACT JS
5. AUXIOS FOR COINGECCO API

The main brach consists the build version of the app that is also the source of the deployment at 'https://cryptodefi.netlify.app/'
And the source code for the same is provided in the source branch
